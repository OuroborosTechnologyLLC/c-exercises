# Readme
Exercises taken from the 1988 book "The C Programming Language Second Edition"
by Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie. It is assumed that the user has
access to the book for context, but each exercise is written out. The programs
themselves are typically taken from the text, and the exercises usually build on
what is already written.

## Formatting
Each program is named after the Chapter and Section it is taken from.

`ex-1-2.c` would come from chapter 1, section 2.
