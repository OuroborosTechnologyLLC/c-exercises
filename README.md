# Readme
Exercises taken from the 1988 book "The C Programming Language Second Edition"
by Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie. It is assumed that the user has
access to the book for context, but each exercise is written out. The programs
themselves are typically taken from the text, and the exercises usually build on
what is already written.

## Formatting
Each program is named after the Chapter and Section it is taken from.

`ex-1-2.c` would come from chapter 1, section 2. This section includes exercises
1-3 and 1-4, but you'd need the book to know that.

## Note
Not all exercises are done here. For instance, exercise 1-5 is about `for`
loops, and I found that unnecessary to write out.
